        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up water, this can be in a pot or a kettle</li>
            <li>Chop up an onion</li>
            <li>Wash the fresh tomatoes, scotch bonnet and bell pepper</li>
            <li>Put the tomatoes, scotch bonnet, bell pepper and an onion into a blender and blend</li>
            <li>After blending pour into a bowl</li>
            <li>By now the water should be boiling already, put your rice into a bowl and add the boiling water, steer the rice then cover it with a lid (this could be flat plate or the lid of a pot</li>
            <li>Place an empty pot on the cooker, add a bit of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion into the pot, and let if fry for a little, pay attention to it so it doesn't burn</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoe paste next and steer, allow to fry for about two mins</li>
            <li>Pour the blended tomatoes and pepper into the pot</li>
            <li>Add salt, stock cubes, curry and thyme</li>
            <li>Add stock (gotten after boiling your chicken, checkout fried chicken recipe <a href="./fried-chicken.html">Click here</a>)</li>
            <li>Add about half cup of water, then allow to boil for about 3-5 mins, while you wait for that proceed to the next step</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the rice (use a sieve)</li>
            <li>Add the rice to the boiling stew,(by now it should be about 3-5mins already)</li>
            <li>Mix the rice with your spoon/spatula, <strong>This should be the only time you mix the rice still it is fully cooked </strong></li>
            <li>Add just enough water to cover the rice</li>
            <li>Leave to cook, check regularly, when you notice the water's dried up, use your spoon to take a bit of rice, taste to find out if it's soft enough</li>
            <li>If no add a bit more water and repeat the previous step, if yes move on to the next step</li>
            <li>Wait till the water dries up <em>do not panic because it's burning, this is normaal</em></li>
            <li>When there's no more water, steer the rice and be mindful of the burnt part, then your <strong>Jollof rice </strong>is ready to be served</li>
        </ol>
